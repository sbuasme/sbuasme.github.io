                <a class = "description">Long story short, we want to make sure that you (even if you're not a mechanical engineering major) grow socially and professionally. 
                    We've already fostered a community of like minded individuals, and all you have to do is show up and meet 
                    them! Engineering is a pretty tight knit community at Stony Brook University, with many of your 
                    classes being with the same group of people. Meeting them beforehand makes sure you always have someone 
                    to turn to in class, and of course, who doesn't like new friends? We also host resume workshops, 
                    internship panels, and alumni visits to make sure your professional life will be as strong as your 
                    social one. Add competitions (with prizes), projects, volunteer work, and all sorts of other hands-on engineering 
                    experience, and you've got ASME.</a>

                <a class = "sectionheader">WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR</a><br>
                <a class = "description">For over seven years, we've been hosting workshops and club collaborations to make sure 
                    that you have every opportunity you need to be successful. More than that, we use the engineering expertise of 
                    our club members to give back to the community. Take one of our most recent projects, Go Baby Go, where we modify 
                    ride-on toys for kids with cerebral palsy. We'll take you through the design process, teach you how to wire 
                    components, and at the end of the day you'll get to put a smile on the faces of children in spite of some dire 
                    circumstances. And that's only one of the many projects we have.</a>

                <a class = "description">It's simple: social and professional growth. All we need is a steady base of people to show up to our 
                    events and pay attention to what we do. In return, you'll get hands-on engineering experience and a large new group of 
                    friends. You'll learn everything from how we plan out large projects to the intricacies of writing code. And of course, 
                    ASME looks great on a resume.</a>

                        This is an interactive workshop, with a presentation from the IT/Engineering Career Coach and a panel discussion from students in CEAS, followed by a Workathon. 
                        Topics will include personal branding, seeking out mentorship, and advocating for yourself as an intern in the workplace. Pizza will be served!

We will make modifications to a ride-on car including a push button attached to the steering wheel, extra seating support, and more. These additions will make it possible for children with muscular limitations to gain some independence as they ride around on their own!
