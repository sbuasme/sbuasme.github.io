                <div class = "eventDescription" style = "margin-top: 20px;">I am a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering. In addition to being a part of ASME, 
                    I am a first year mentor in the WISE honors program. In my free time I enjoy reading, 
                    listening to music, and working on computer aided design. I have experience with SOLIDWORKS, 
                    AutoCAD, and Fusion 360 that I hope to share with everyone through CAD workshops this year. 
                    In addition, I love going to amusement parks and riding various roller coasters, which inspired 
                    my choice of mechanical engineering in the first place. I hope to use my degree to become a roller 
                    coaster engineer in the future. I am thrilled to be the vice president of ASME this year and have 
                    the opportunity to help the club expand and improve. Some of my goals as vice president include 
                    increasing our membership, hosting exciting and useful events and collaborations, and providing our 
                    members with the opportunity to network and grow professionally. One of my favorite events that ASME 
                    hosts is Go Baby Go, where we modify toy ride-on vehicles so that children with cerebral palsy can use 
                    them. I look forward to a fun and productive year with ASME! </div>

                    I am a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering here at 
                    Stony Brook. I got involved in ASME my freshman year and have enjoyed the many different events that we have had. 
                    Some events that I have enjoyed are our CAD software events as well as our fun games and activities like brain 
                    teaser meetings. I hope to continue these events this year as well and hope to inspire others the same way the 
                    past leaders of this club have inspired me. In my future I have hopes of being a ride design engineer. This 
                    involves hard work and dedication to the major and my school work which I am excited to be doing here at Stony 
                    Brook. I am excited to be a part of this club because I believe it a great way to learn about Mechanical 
                    Engineering in the real world while also making connections with others in the engineering field. I am hopeful 
                    for this year as a part of ASME and I look forward to creating connections with others.

                    Andrew Kudler is a Sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering who has been active in the Stony Brook Chapter of ASME since 2021. 
                    Having a keen interest in machine learning and programming, he joined ASME to expand his knowledge of the mechanical engineering 
                    field while also promoting it to those who may be interested in it. Outside of ASME, Andrew is also the treasurer for Stony Brook 
                    University's Quiz Bowl and Comic Book clubs and is a member of the Sigma Beta Honor Society. While he does not know where 
                    mechanical engineering will take him in the future, Andrew is excited to be more involved with it through ASME.
